# Sitemapper

Implement a quick crawler and sitemap generator. Prints sitemap to screen.

Created for a quick technical test.

Will grab a pseudo-random Neocities site by default
(It's the future of the Interwebs, _make the web fun again_!!!)

## Builds

[![CircleCI master Tests](https://circleci.com/gh/dm/techtest-sitemapper/tree/master.svg?style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/dm/techtest-sitemapper/tree/master)

## Easy run

Assumptions:
 * Running on a \*nix based OS
 * [Docker is installed](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)
 * Grab a nice cup of coffee
 * `make`
 * ???
 * Profit!


## Makefile

Arguments to php script are passed through ENV vars (`URL` and `PAGES`)

 * List all: `make help`
 * Tests (Docker): `make docker-test`
 * Tests: `make test`
 * Run (Docker): `make docker-run URL=https://2bit.neocities.org/ PAGES=100`
 * Run: `make run URL=https://2bit.neocities.org/ PAGES=20`


## Implementation

* Dockerise console app
* TDD
* Symfony components


## Notes

 * Should limit to domain and number of pages to crawl...
 * Time won't allow for much, focused on main task deliverable, and documenting decisions being made.
 * Dockerise each components for faster setup/review? At least add `Makefile`!
 * Sitemaps support media (images/video), there might be no time to support these
 * Won't make this horizontally scalable async crawler (Queue service, would be great to add a Python parser and Golang async service broker!


## Limitation

 * Hard limit on 2 hours, which is severely limiting.
 * Will take the "please donâ€™t spend much more than that", and have a little leeway...
